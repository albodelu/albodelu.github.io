title: Hello World! - Your blog in a few minutes!
---

Hi, I'm Al, an Android Developer learning the Kotlin programming language and writing his first blog!

I'm doing it in English because I want to practice it but sometimes i'll share links in Spanish, sorry about that. 

Below you'll find instructions to create a blog in minutes using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

But after years thinking about it, I was lazy and used this [short video in Spanish](https://youtu.be/lsvRyE5tPQQ).

Thanks to [Antonio Leiva](https://antonioleiva.com/), the author of the video and [this awesome Kotlin book](https://antonioleiva.com/kotlin-android-developers-book/) I just started to read!

The next lines and this post are the result to follow [barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) Readme file.

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
