title: Hello Kotlin! - Your Kotlin App in a few minutes!
---

In the previous post I talked you about [Antonio Leiva's Kotlin book](https://antonioleiva.com/kotlin-android-developers-book/) and [how to create a blog in a few minutes](https://albodelu.github.io/01-Hello-World/). In this post I'm going to explain you how I created [my first Kotlin App](https://github.com/albodelu/first-project-kotlin) in a few minutes!

I bought his book because I want the best sources and reading when I improve my skills, by the way, Mark Murphy updated [his android Development book](https://commonsware.com/blog/2017/04/17/busy-coders-guide-android-development-8.5-released.html) to version 8.5, I'm also a big fan.

Really it took me longer because I was also reading about the new [build cache feature of Gradle 3.5](https://blog.gradle.org/introducing-gradle-build-cache), but I finally used the 3.3 version this time.

If you create a new [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) project following the free guide I'm going to share with you, you'll find some differences like the [new constraint layout](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/constraint-layout/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0) but it's very simple to follow anyway, just create a new ``LinearLayout``.

I would like to add my first lines of code to this blog, I already added [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for comments, but I'm going to eat dinner, and the real secret to create the app so fast it's just to use [this free guide](https://antonioleiva.com/free-guide/)! (and don't read my long posts).

Happy Coding!
